Welcome to the BeastieBox project Homepage

   BeastieBox is an attempt to bring a [1]Busybox-like tool to the BSD
   world (and yes, I'm aware of [2]crunchgen). BeastieBox aims to be small
   while keeping as much features as possible.

   While in its early stages, it is capable of being used as a replacement
   for some well-known UNIX commands using the BusyBox method of linking
   wanted commands to the "beastiebox" binary

   Three modes are currently available: a semi-static mode, where all
   commands will be statically linked to the main executable, still
   dynamically linked over libc and libm, a full static mode, where the
   produced binary is statically linked over all needed libraries, and a
   dynamic mode, where commands are available as shared objects. As an
   example, when using dynamic mode, "beastiebox" binary will load
   libifconfig.so when invoking the ifconfig command.

   As of now, the following commands are available :

   ifconfig, route, sh, ls, init, ln, mount, mount_ffs, df, cat, rm, fsck,
   fsck_ffs, ps, kill, dmesg, hostname, cp, mv, test, [, sed, ping, less,
   more, sysctl, pfctl, wiconfig, traceroute, stty, date, reboot, halt,
   poweroff, chmod, umount, ex, vi, fdisk, disklabel, tar, getty, login,
   [3]mksh

   Most of these commands are ports of [4]NetBSD 4.0 userland commands,
   but some of them, in order to minimize dependencies and size, are older
   NetBSD versions, older BSD versions (i.e. 4.4BSD Lite2), or BSD-license
   compatible software. The goal is to obtain a functionnal BSD UN*X
   system fitting into 500K in semi-static mode, in order to be used in
   embedded hardware like Wireless routers, ADSL boxes, multimedia hard
   drives and such. As of today, BeastieBox is about 700K.

   As you may have guessed, the current work is done under NetBSD, but
   should easily be ported to FreeBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFlyBSD.

   BeastieBox is a work-in-progress, I'm doing this on my spare time and a
   "stable" version will probably be out... when it's ready ;) Until then,
   either look at it, play with it, port it or provide some help, but
   please do not request anything. We'll see that another day.

   BeastieBox is covered by a two-clauses [5]BSD License.

   Now if you're still motivated, you can try BeastieBox this way :
$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@beastiebox.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/beastiebox l
ogin
$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@beastiebox.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/beastiebox c
o beastiebox

   And from there, read the README file

   If you're just curious, you can also browse [6]BeastieBox cvsweb

   Here's a screenshot of NetBSD 4.0 kernel booting on BeastieBox
   (symlinks are for eye's pleasure only) :

   If you have NBD support enabled in your kernel, you can use this
   to read a file over HTTP as a block device. The most obvious use
   for me was (is) to mount ISO images without having to download
   them entirely. If your linux distribution installer allows early
   console access, you should be able to even install the OS from
   a CD ISO over HTTP.
   Sources are available [1]here.
   To use it, compile (you need kernel headers and pthreads
   installed), load the kernel module and run nbd-http:
   make
   modprobe nbd
   ./nbd-http /dev/nbd0 http://mirror.org/file.iso
   (and in another console:)
   mount /dev/nbd0 /mnt/cdrom
   Due to the nbd driver using the userland process to make block
   requests, there is apparently no other way to stop the nbd
   userland helper other than ``killlal -9 nbd-http''.

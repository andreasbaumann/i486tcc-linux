   What's worse than an unsafe private key? An unsafe public key.

   The "secure" in secure shell comes from the combination of hashing,
   symmetric encryption, and asymmetric encryption. Together, SSH uses
   cryptographic primitives to safely connect clients and servers. In the
   25 years since its founding, computing power and speeds in accordance
   with [61]Moore's Law have necessitated increasingly complicated
   low-level algorithms. This article will focus on asymmetric keygen
   algorithms.

   As of 2020, the most widely adopted algorithms are RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and
   EdDSA, but it is RSA and EdDSA that provide the best security and
   performance.

Encryption Within the SSH Protocol

   SSH is used almost universally to connect to shells on remote machines.
   The most important part of an SSH session is establishing a secure
   connection. This happens in two broad steps:
     * Negotiation & Connection
     * Authentication

Negotiation & Connection

   In order for an SSH session to work, both client and server must
   support the same version of the SSH protocol. Modern clients will
   support SSH 2.0, as SSH 1.0 has [62]identified flaws. After coming to a
   consensus on which protocol version to follow, both machines negotiate
   a per-session symmetric key to encrypt the connection from the outside.
   Generating a symmetric key at this stage, when paired with the
   asymmetric keys in authentication, prevents the entire session from
   being [63]compromised if a key is revealed. Negotiation terms happen
   through the [64]Diffie-Helman key exchange, which creates a shared
   secret key to secure the whole data stream by combining the private key
   of one party with the public key of the other. These keys are different
   from the SSH keys used for authentication. For those interested in
   learning more about this step, this comprehensive article, [65]SSH
   Handshake Explained, is a great starting point.

   Figure 1: Shared Secret Creation

Authentication

   After completing the negotiation and connection, a reliable and secure
   channel between the client and server has been established. During the
   KEX, the client has authenticated the server, but the server has not
   yet authenticated the client. In most cases, public-key authentication
   is used by the client. This method involves two keys, a [66]public and
   private key. Either can be used to encrypt a message, but the other
   must be used to decrypt. This is what is meant by asymmetric
   encryption. [Figure 2] If Bob encrypts a message with Alice's public
   key, only Alice's private key can decrypt the message. This principle
   is what allows the SSH protocol to authenticate identity. If Alice
   (client) can decrypt Bob's (server) message, then it proves Alice is in
   possession of the paired private key. This is, in theory, how SSH keys
   authentication should work. Unfortunately with the dynamic nature of
   infrastructure today, SSH keys are increasingly shared or [67]managed
   improperly, compromising its integrity. To learn more, read this
   article, [68]How to SSH Properly.

   [69]Figure 2: Only Alice's private key can decrypt a message signed
   with Alice's public key

Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms

   What makes asymmetric encryption powerful is that a private key can be
   used to derive a paired public key, but not the other way around. This
   principle is core to public-key authentication. If Alice had used a
   weak encryption algorithm that could be brute-forced by today's
   processing capabilities, a third party could derive Alice's private key
   using her public key. Protecting against a threat like this requires
   careful selection of the right algorithm.

   There are three classes of these algorithms commonly used for
   asymmetric encryption: RSA, DSA, and elliptic curve based algorithms.
   To properly evaluate the strength and integrity of each algorithm, it
   is necessary to understand the mathematics that constitutes the core of
   each algorithm.

RSA: Integer Factorization

   First used in 1978, the RSA cryptography is based on the held belief
   that factoring large semi-prime numbers is difficult by nature. Given
   that no general-purpose formula has been found to factor a compound
   number into its prime factors, there is a direct relationship between
   the size of the factors chosen and the time required to compute the
   solution. In other words, given a number n=p\*q where p and q are
   sufficiently large prime numbers, it can be assumed that anyone who can
   factor n into its component parts is the only party that knows the
   values of p and q. The same logic exists for public and private keys.
   In fact, p & q are necessary variables for the creation of a private
   key, and n is a variable for the subsequent public key. This
   presentation simplifies RSA integer factorization. For those interested
   in learning more, [70]click here.

DSA: Discrete Logarithm Problem & Modular Exponentiation

   DSA follows a similar schema, as RSA with public/private keypairs that
   are mathematically related. What makes DSA different from RSA is that
   DSA uses a different algorithm. It solves an entirely different problem
   using different elements, equations, and steps. While the discrete log
   problem is fun, it is [71]out of scope for this post. What is important
   to note is the use of a randomly generated number, m, is used with
   signing a message along with a private key, k. This number m must be
   kept private. More in this later.

ECDSA & EdDSA: Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem

   Algorithms using elliptic curves are also based on the assumption that
   there is no generally efficient solution to solving a discrete log
   problem. However, ECDSA/EdDSA and DSA differ in that DSA uses a
   mathematical operation known as modular exponentiation while
   ECDSA/EdDSA uses elliptic curves. The computational complexity of the
   discrete log problem allows both classes of algorithms to achieve the
   same level of security as RSA with significantly smaller keys.

Comparing Encryption Algorithms

   Choosing the right algorithm depends on a few criteria:
     * Implementation - Can the experts handle it, or does it need to be
       rolled?
     * Compatibility - Are there SSH clients that do not support a method?
     * Performance - How long will it take to generate a sufficiently
       secure key?
     * Security - Can the public key be derived from the private key? (The
       use of quantum computing to break encryption is not discussed in
       this article.)

RSA

   Implementation

   RSA libraries can be found for all major languages, including in-depth
   libraries ([72]JS, [73]Python, [74]Go, [75]Rust, [76]C).
   Compatibility

   Usage of SHA-1 ([77]OpenSSH) or public keys under 2048-bits may be
   unsupported.
    Performance   Larger keys require more time to generate.
      Security

   Specialized algorithms like [78]Quadratic Sieve and [79]General Number
   Field Sieve exist to factor integers with specific qualities.

   Time has been RSA's greatest ally and greatest enemy. First published
   in 1977, RSA has the widest support across all SSH clients and
   languages and has truly stood the test of time as a reliable key
   generation method. Subsequently, it has also been subject to Moore's
   Law for decades and key bit-length has grown in size. According to NIST
   standards, achieving 128-bit security requires a key with length 3072
   bits whereas other algorithms use smaller keys. Bit security measures
   the number of trials required to brute-force a key. 128 bit security
   means 2^128 trials to break.
   RSA key bit-length
   RSA key bit-length

   [80]Figure 4 - NIST 2020 Recommendations for RSA key bit-length
   (Factoring Modulus)

DSA

   Implementation

   DSA was adopted by FIPS-184 in 1994. It has ample representation in
   [81]major crypto libraries, similar to RSA.
   Compatibility

   While DSA enjoys support for PuTTY-based clients, OpenSSH 7.0
   [82]disables DSA by default.
   Performance

   [83]Significant improvement in key generation times to achieve
   comparable security strengths, though recommended bit-length is the
   same as RSA.
      Security

   DSA requires the use of a randomly generated unpredictable and secret
   value that, [84]if discovered, can reveal the private key.

   Recall earlier in the article:

   "What is important to note is the use of a randomly generated number,
   m, is used with signing a message along with a private key, k. This
   number m must be kept privately."

   The value mis meant to be a nonce, which is a unique value included in
   many cryptographic protocols. However, the additional conditions of
   unpredictability and secrecy makes the nonce more akin to a key, and
   therefore extremely important.

   Not only is it difficult to [85]ensure true randomness within a
   machine, but improper implementation can break encryption. For example:
    1. Android's Java SecureRandom class was known to create [86]colliding
       R values. In other words, the class reused some randomly generated
       numbers. This exposed a number of different [87]Android-based
       Bitcoin wallets to having their private keys stolen. The
       requirements of the nonce m means that any two instances with the
       same nonce value could be reverse engineered and reveal the private
       key used to sign transactions.
    2. Taking this a step further, [88]fail0verflow discovered the private
       key used to sign firmware updates for the Sony Playstation 3. In
       other words, programmers could write their own code, sign it with
       the revealed private key, and run it on the PS3. As it turns out,
       Sony was using the [89]same random number to sign each message.

ECDSA & EdDSA

   The two examples above are not entirely sincere. Both Sony and the
   Bitcoin protocol employ ECDSA, not DSA proper. ECDSA is an elliptic
   curve implementation of DSA. Functionally, where RSA and DSA require
   key lengths of 3072 bits to provide 128 bits of security, ECDSA can
   accomplish the same with only 256-bit keys. However, ECDSA relies on
   the same level of randomness as DSA, so the only gain is speed and
   length, [90]not security.

   In response to the desired speeds of elliptic curves and the undesired
   security risks, another class of curves has gained some notoriety.
   EdDSA solves the same discrete log problem as DSA/ECDSA, but uses a
   different family of elliptic curves known as the [91]Edwards Curve
   (EdDSA uses a [92]Twisted Edwards Curve). While offering slight
   advantages in speed over ECDSA, its popularity comes from an
   improvement in security. Instead of relying on a random number for the
   nonce value, EdDSA generates a nonce deterministically as a hash making
   it collision resistant.

   Taking a step back, the use of elliptic curves does not automatically
   guarantee some level of security. Not all curves are the same. Only a
   [93]few curves have made it past rigorous testing. Luckily, the PKI
   industry has slowly come to adopt [94]Curve25519 in particular for
   EdDSA. Put together that makes the public-key signature algorithm,
   [95]Ed25519.
   Implementation

   EdDSA is fairly new [96]Crypto++ and [97]cryptlib do not currently
   support EdDSA.
   Compatibility

   Compatible with newer clients, Ed25519 has seen the [98]largest
   adoption among the Edward Curves, though NIST also proposed Ed448 in
   their recent draft of [99]SP 800-186.
    Performance

   Ed25519 is the fastest performing algorithm across all metrics. As with
   ECDSA, public keys are twice the length of the desired bit security.
      Security

   EdDSA provides the [100]highest security level compared to key length.
   It also improves on the insecurities found in ECDSA.

RSA vs. DSA vs. ECDSA vs. EdDSA

   Below we list the common differences between RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA
   algorithms:
   RSA DSA ECDSA EdDSA
   Popularity Most widely implemented and supported. Its notorious
   security history makes it less popular. Fairly new but not as popular
   as EdDSA. Fairly new but favoured by most modern cryptographic
   libraries.
   Performance Larger keys require more time to generate. Faster for
   signature generation but slower for validation. Public keys are twice
   the length of the desired bit security. EdDSA is the fastest performing
   algorithm across all metrics.
   Security Specialized algorithms like [101]Quadratic Sieve and
   [102]General Number Field Sieve exist to factor integers with specific
   qualities. DSA requires the use of a randomly generated unpredictable
   and secret value that, [103]if discovered, can reveal the private key.
   Vulnerable if pseudo random number aren't cryptographically strong.
   EdDSA provides the highest security level compared to key length. It
   also improves on the insecurities found in ECDSA.

How to generate SSH keys with RSA, DSA, ECDSA, or EdDSA?

   RSA is the default key type when generated using the ssh-keygen
   command. To generate SSH keys with given algorithm type, supply -t flag
   to ssh-keygen command. Below is an example of generating ed25519 key:
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "unique name to identify this key."

   Both public and private keys (ssh key pair) are generated with the
   above command. The private key never leave user's computer, and the
   public key is stored in the server's authorized_keys file.

   The SSH key fingerprint can be checked with the following command:
$ ssh-keygen -l -f <key file>

   For more details, [104]learn how to generate SSH keys.

Conclusion

   When it comes down to it, the choice is between RSA 2048/4096 and
   Ed25519 and the trade-off is between performance and compatibility. RSA
   is universally supported among SSH clients while EdDSA performs much
   faster and provides the same level of security with significantly
   smaller keys. Peter Ruppel puts the answer succinctly:

     The short answer to this is: as long as the key strength is good
     enough for the foreseeable future, it doesn't really matter. Because
     here we are considering a signature for authentication within an SSH
     session. The cryptographic strength of the signature just needs to
     withstand the current, state-of-the-art attacks.

   Just don't use ECDSA/DSA!

Certificates better than keys

   Although keys are a relatively secure authentication method for SSH
   when compared with password-based authentication, keys create an equal
   amount of operational and security overhead on the administration side.
   Key rotation and key invalidation remain a challenge that can be
   resolved using certificate-based authentication. Teleport offers
   [106]SSH certificate-based access solution with additional benefits of
   audit logging, session recording, and RBAC for SSH. Teleport is open
   source and can be used as a drop replacement for OpenSSH servers. Learn

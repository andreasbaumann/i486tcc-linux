Kernel Size Reduction Work

   From eLinux.org
   Jump to: [3]navigation, [4]search

   This page has a list of of recent (as of 2014) ideas and projects for
   Linux kernel size reduction.

   As of June, 2014, [5]Linux Tiny was no longer maintained. However, new
   efforts to support Linux as a viable option on micro-controllers and
   deeply embedded systems have led to renewed interest in extreme size
   reduction of the kernel. Some good projects were described at ELC 2014.

            minimal kernel for very small embedded systems

List of recently used techniques

Vitaly Wool's project

     * kernel XIP
     * dietnet
     * ARM thumb mode
     * application XIP on squashfs

micro-yocto project

     * net-diet
     * LTO
     * SYSFS_SYSCALL
     * USELIB
     * BUG_ON
     * X86_IOPORT
     * CONFIG_PTRACE
     * CONFIG_SIGNALS
     * no sys_sendfile

     * network reductions:
          + replace kernel stack with user-space stack (LWIP)
          + TCP/UDP echo (requires app changes)

instrumentation

   microYocto tracing hash triggers

auto-reduce

     * LTO
     * syscall filtering
     * command line filtering
     * global constraints
     * kernel stack size

Kernel string refactorization

     * refactor strings in the kernel so that they are more efficiently
       used
     * here is a [23]report on this work getting started

Ideas for new reductions

     * trace-guided optimization
     * cold code compression
          + use U of Gent code to re-try cold code compression

       and products

Meetings and Discussions

Kernel Summit 2014

   Josh Triplett has proposed a session discussing size issues at the 2014
   Kernel Summit. His draft list of proposed topics was the following:
   Topics:
     * An overview of why the kernel's size still matters today ("but
       don't we all have tons of memory and storage?")
     * Tiny in RAM versus tiny on storage.
     * How much the kernel has grown over time.
     * How size regressions happen and how to avoid them
     * Size measurement, bloat-o-meter, allnoconfig, and other tools
     * Compression and the decompression stub
     * Kconfig, and avoiding excessive configurability in the pursuit of
       tiny
     * Optimizing a kernel for its exact target userspace.
     * Examples of shrinking the kernel
     * Discussion on proposed ways to make the kernel tiny, how much they
       might save, how much work they'd require, and how to implement them
       with minimal impact to the un-shrunken common case.

Size/IOT summit at ELC Europe 2014

   We are considering holding a Size/IOT meeting at ELC Europe. Details
   will be placed here should this meeting end up being organized.

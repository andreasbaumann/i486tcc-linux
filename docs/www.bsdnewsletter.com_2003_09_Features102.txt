   Building tiny systems with embedded NetBSD
   By Brian Rose

Overview

   NetBSD is an extremely flexible operating system that is designed to be
   portable across various architectures. This feature makes it attractive
   for embedded developers. In this article, I will demonstrate a process
   for creating a very small kernel that can boot, either to a shell
   prompt or to a login screen.

   Booting to the shell prompt allows the developer to quickly give life
   to a system and perform some basic interactions. The shell itself can
   be a powerful management tool, combined with the right collection of
   programs. Doing this requires only the kernel and two binaries.

   Booting to a login prompt provides a little added security by
   controlling access to the machine. This would be useful in devices
   where the console can be accessed by the user, and you need to control
   what the user has access to. There are a few added files in this setup,
   and to keep things small, you will need to manually trim some of them.
   But this is still a very easy process.

The minimum single user system

   The first stage of embedded development usually involves getting a
   skeleton operating system up and running. Assuming you are using one of
   NetBSD many supported platforms, this is quite easy. I used a PC
   booting off of a floppy drive. But this method can also be easily
   adapted to handle diskless clients that boot off a network.

   At an absolute minimum, you will need the kernel, the /dev nodes for
   your system, and a /sbin/init file. You can craft the init program
   yourself, putting all of your application code into it. This may be a
   good solution when you only have one application that you would like to
   run.

   Another option is to use the stock init program and a shell to call
   your application. This is a bit easier than writing your own init
   program, and it also allows you to add functionality to your system by
   simply adding more tools from the stock system. The shell itself is a
   powerful tool that can make future development much easier. This is the
   method that will be illustrated here.

Building the kernel

   The first thing that needs to be done is to build a kernel with a built
   in ramdisk. The ramdisk will hold the kernel's root filesystem. A good
   kernel configuration to start with is the INSTALL_TINY configuration.
   This kernel has all the important stuff in it, without a lot of bloat.
   Make sure that it has the following lines in it.

   in sys/arch/[arch]/conf
$ cp INSTALL_TINY MYTINY
$ vi MYTINY

# Enable the hooks used for initializing the root memory-disk.
options     MEMORY_DISK_HOOKS
options     MEMORY_DISK_IS_ROOT         # force root on memory disk
options     MEMORY_DISK_SERVER=1        # make the ramdisk writeable
#options    MEMORY_DISK_ROOT_SIZE=2880  # 1.44M, same as a floppy
options     MEMORY_DISK_ROOT_SIZE=8192  # 4Meg
options     MEMORY_RBFLAGS=0            # don't force single user

   This configuration includes ramdisk support, has the kernel boot from
   the ramdisk, allows the ramdisk to be written to, sets the size a 8192
   sectors (512 bytes each), and allows the kernel to boot into multiuser
   mode (if the files are available).

   You will also need to check the ramdisk driver to make sure that it
   supports the MEMORY_RBFLAGS option. In my 1.6.0 system, it did not, so
   I needed to add the following code.

   in sys/dev/md_root.c
 /*
  * This is called during open (i.e. mountroot)
  */

 ##  #ifndef MEMORY_RBFLAGS
 ##  #define MEMORY_RBFLAGS RB_SINGLE
 ##  #endif

 void
 md_open_hook(int unit, struct md_conf *md)
 {

     //            ............................... added code
     if (unit == 0 && (MEMORY_RBFLAGS & RB_SINGLE) ) {

     /* The root ramdisk only works single-user. */
     boothowto |= RB_SINGLE;
     }
 }

   Once this is done, build your kernel.
$ config MYTINY
$ cp ../compile/MYTINY
$ make depend; make

Creating the crunched binaries

   Although you could copy the binaries from your host into your mini
   filesystem, a more efficient way (sizewise) to do this is to use a
   utility called crunchgen. Many programs in the NetBSD system are linked
   statically. For example, each program that uses the utility library
   (libutil) has one copy of the library linked to it. Several programs on
   the system produce redundant copies of the libraries used by the
   programs. Crunchgen takes the programs' object files and merges them
   into one uber-program. This crunched binary is then linked to the
   libraries, so only one copy of the library is needed for the whole
   system.

   "But how do I use the different programs?", you ask. The answer lies in
   hard links. A hard link is like a filesystem's alias for a program. For
   example, If I have a program called print_my_error, I can link that to
   the alias myerr. Then when I invoke myerr, the filesystem simply
   follows the link and runs the program print_my_error. I can even make
   the two program names have slightly different behavior. This is done by
   having print_my_error look at argv[0] that is passed to the main()
   function. If it is myerr, then I can have it do a special task.

   This is how crunchgen works. It takes all of its constituent programs
   and globs them together. Then in the crunched binary's main routine,
   there is logic that examines argv[0] and calls the main routine for the
   appropriate constituent.

   To make a crunched binary, you need to know what binaries you want,
   where their sources are located, and what libraries they use. Once you
   settle on what binaries to use, simply search the /usr/src folder for
   the sources. The layout of /usr/src is straightforward. To look for the
   source for /sbin/init, you would look in /usr/src/sbin/init. To find
   the /usr/bin/login, go to /usr/src/usr.bin/login. To find out which
   libraries are used, open up the program's Makefile, and look for the
   LDADD lines. You should see entries like "-lutil -lcrypt".

   Sometimes, programs in the NetBSD distribution are simply hardlinks to
   another program. For example, mount_mfs is an alias for newfs. You will
   find no /usr/src/sbin/mount_mfs directory. So how do you find out where
   the sources are for mount_mfs? Search through the makefiles for "LINKS=
   ${BINDIR}/newfs ${BINDIR}/mount_mfs". This shows you that the Makefile
   will link mount_mfs to newfs.
$  find /usr/src -name Makefile -exec grep mount_mfs {} \;
MAN=    newfs.8 mount_mfs.8
LINKS=  ${BINDIR}/newfs ${BINDIR}/mount_mfs
MLINKS= mount_mfs.8 mfs.8

   Armed with this information, you can now create your crunchgen
   configuration file. This is just a list of the above information. There
   are some additional features, which I will outline below.

srcdirs /usr/src/bin /usr/src/sbin

progs init sh reboot ls

ln sh -sh

special init objpaths /usr/src/sbin/init/obj/init.smallprog.o


# libraries used by the programs
# ---------------- Minimum single user files
# init : -lutil -lcrypt
# sh : -ll -ledit -ltermcap
# ---------------- Useful utilities
# ls : -
# reboot : -lutil
#
libs -lutil -lcrypt -ll -ledit -ltermcap

   The first line tells crunchgen where to look for sources. It looks for
   the sources by appending the program name onto the listed directories.
   The progs line is the list of programs that you want included in your
   binary. The ln lines tell crunchgen about aliases that are used for
   some of the programs. The shell is sometimes invoked as -sh, so the
   crunched binary will recognize "-sh" as "sh". Also, as noted above,
   some binaries are simply aliases for other programs. The crunched
   binary needs to be on the lookout for these aliases as well.

   The special line tells crunchgen that init should not be built from
   source, but rather just use the specified object file. In this case, I
   built the init program with the SMALLPROG #define, so I don't get the
   annoying "Enter pathname of shell or RETURN for sh:" prompt when the
   system starts in single user mode. Instead, it will silently drop to
   the shell prompt. To do this, I build my special init program this way.
$ cd /usr/src/sbin/init
$ make -D SMALLPROG
$ cp obj/init.o obj/init.smallprog.o

   This functionality makes it easy to customize your system without too
   much trouble. You could create a customized version of a standard
   program and use that in your embedded builds, while keeping the
   original for other purposes.

   Finally, the last line tells crunchgen which libraries to link to.
   Again, you can get this information by looking through the Makefiles
   for the constituent programs and noting the LDADD lines. I've had
   trouble with library ordering, so if you have errors indicating
   unresolved externals, and you know you included the library, try moving
   the "missing" library closer to the front of the list. This worked for
   me.

   Once your crunchgen file is crafted, build it with the following
   commands. The finished executable will be named after your conf file,
   but without the conf extension.
$ crunchgen -m Makefile mytiny.conf
$ make -f Makefile objs exe

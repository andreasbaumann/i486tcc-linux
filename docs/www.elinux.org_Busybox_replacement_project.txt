Description

   Busybox is a widely used program which implements several Linux command
   line utilities in a single, multi-tool binary. It is provided under the
   GPL license. Due to its utility and ubiquity, it has been used in a
   very large number of embedded devices. This includes use by companies
   who are not as diligent about their GPL commitments as they should be.

   Busybox is arguably the most litigated piece of GPL software in the
   world. Unfortunately, it is unclear what the remedy should be when a
   GPL violation occurs with busybox. Litigants have sometimes requested
   remedies outside the scope of busybox itself, such as review authority
   over unrelated products, or right of refusal over non-busybox modules.
   This causes concern among chip vendors and suppliers.

   The purpose of this project is to produce a program that is as capable
   and useful as busybox for a large majority of embedded Linux projects,
   such that busybox is easy to replace in existing products and can be
   supplanted as the default choice for a multi-tool program in most new
   projects.

Supported Commands

   It is expected that the first major milestone release (version 1.0) of
   the busybox replacement program will include the following commands:
   [See the project page.]

Scope

   The scope of the project is dependent on the target use cases that are
   envisioned for the replacement tool. Busybox is currently used in a
   very large number of places, and it is impractical to replace it's full
   functionality in a short time. However, busybox as it currently stands
   includes very many non-essential programs and features. The overall
   goal would be to provide essential busybox functionality (e.g. with
   that contained in busybox version 1.0).

   One additional area of commands which is outside the traditional
   busybox coverage area, is Android tools provided by toolbox. Toolbox is
   a non-GPL multi-tool program provided as part of the Android Open
   Source Project, and used in Android devices. It is limited in
   functionality, however, compared to busybox, and so many developers
   install busybox in their Android devices to supplement the command set.
   Google has a goal of reducing the amount of GPL software in user-space
   for Android devices. A busybox replacement that implemented the toolbox
   commands could useful to avoid having Android developer adopt busybox
   by default. But more importantly, a replacement that just focused on
   the weaknesses of toolbox could serve this tool supplementation role
   that busybox fills, with very little effort.

   It is expected that it will require about 6 months of part-time
   developer work to achieve the first major milestone for the project.

   This project will very likely start with a base of non-GPL software
   which is already available, and has been scrutinized to be free from
   GPL legal encumbrances, from the Toybox project

Comments

   People interested in supporting this project can do one of several
   things:
     * If you are an embedded Linux developer, you can start working on
       the ToyBox code, adding commands or features to it.
     * If you are a company interested in sponsoring or donating
       engineering resources to this project, please contact Tim Bird. (I
       used to have my Sony e-mail address here, but it gave people the
       wrong impression that this was a Sony project. Please use my gmail

Status

   This project is still Under Construction.

   This project is in the proposal and fact-gathering stage, and is still
   under construction. Please be advised that multiple aspects of this
   project are still being defined and under consideration. We have not
   100% committed to using ToyBox as the replacement, although this seems
   very likely at this point. If the project proceed, then when it is
   launched, it will likely be announced with more firm details about the
   roadmap, governance, license and schedule.

FAQ

     * Q. Simply providing the source, as the licence requires, would
       avoid litigation. Isn't that easier than re-writing busybox?
     * A. It is true that providing the source would avoid litigation. In
       most cases, this *is* easier than re-writing busybox. However, in
       some cases - especially when dealing with a naive or defunct
       supplier, it can be difficult or impossible to find the 'correct'
       source for busybox. It would be better not to get into a situation
       where the lack of correct source from a 3rd party supplier resulted
       in extreme remedies being required. This project aims to make a
       useful alternative to busybox which completely eliminates any
       possibility of infringement, wrongdoing, and risk of litigation for
       this particular piece of software.

     * Q. Isn't this a lot of work to avoid a relatively small effort
       (publishing the source to busybox)?
     * A. It will be some work, but it will likely only have to be done
       once, and the burden and/or cost of the work can be distributed
       throughout the industry. The cost to a single company to support
       this project is very small in comparison to the legal liability and
       costs should some problem occur with busybox compliance.

     * Q. Is this being done to prevent the SFC from asking for the source
       to the Linux kernel?
     * A. No, although it would have that effect. As part of their request
       to remedy a busybox GPL violation, the SFC does ask for source code
       unrelated to busybox. Personally, I believe this is improper.
       However, my main reason for proposing this project is to avoid
       having the SFC gain review authority over unrelated products
       produced by a company. The larger the set of Linux-based products
       that are produced by a company, the greater exposure there is for a
       possible mistake, and the greater potential costs that would incur
       in the event of litigation and/or settlement.

     * Q. Wouldn't it be morally better to help companies fulfill their
       GPL obligations, than to have them avoid GPL software?
     * A. There are multiple people who provide consulting services to
       help people fulfill their GPL obligations. This is a good thing and
       it should be encouraged. Helping companies avoid infringing the
       license of software they use is good. Also good is providing
       software for companies that helps them avoid legal entanglements at
       all. Arguments beyond this get into BSD vs. GPL license wars, which
       I don't think are productive to engage in here.

     * Q. Tim Bird, the proposer of this project, works for Sony. Is this
       a Sony project?
     * A. No. Although Tim is employed by Sony, he spends a portion of his
       employed time working on behalf of the embedded industry to improve
       Linux and encourage GPL compliance. As of February 2, 2012, Sony
       has not endorsed or agreed to support this project. This wiki page
       is for gathering information and project description information,
       to present to various companies to solicit support and resources
       for the project.

     * Q. Can Tim's creation of this proposal be used to infer anything
       about Sony's compliance record, future compliance intent, or other
       business practices?
     * A. Tim has only recently informed his management about this
       proposal, and Sony has not yet (as of 2/2/12) agreed to support it.
       So, "no, not really". Sony has a good compliance record, and has
       strong compliance policies in place. Tim is doing this as part of
       his (paid for by Sony) role in the industry to address issues which
       inhibit the adoption of Linux in consumer electronics.

     * Q. If it doesn't affect Sony, why are you doing this? How does the
       busybox litigation and the remedy terms requested by the SFC
       inhibit the adoption of Linux in consumer electronics?
     * A. It is not expected to affect Sony directly, because Sony has
       good compliance practices. However, any company can make a mistake.
       There are instances where this litigation and the terms requested
       by the SFC have resulted in companies dropping their embedded Linux
       projects. It has also caused even compliant companies to
       re-evaluate their adoption of Linux. This has a net negative effect
       (in my opinion) on the adoption of Linux and ultimate amount of GPL
       software produced. Tim (and Sony) view the production of GPL
       software as a good thing. It does sound strange that this is the
       goal when the proposed project exists to replace a piece of GPL
       software with a non-GPL piece of software, but the overall desired
       affect of this project is to encourage more companies to adopt GPL
       software (particularly the Linux kernel), and to comply with the
       obligations of the GPL license.

   [feel free to add new questions here. The ones above feel a bit
   'rigged'.]

additional questions

     * Q. What companies using Busybox did the SFC request unrelated
       source code from - please clarify unrelated?
     * A. My understanding is that everyone the SFC litigates and
       eventually settles with is required to pass SFC audits for 3 years.
       See [22]http://lwn.net/Articles/478337/ I believe that SFC requires
       auditing of every GPL-based product a company ships, whether or not
       it had compliance issues.

     * Q. What companies dropped embedded Linux projects in response to
       litigation from the SFC??
     * A. LinkSys/Cisco is one example. See
       [23]http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/10437.html?thread=301509#cmt301509

     * Q. What compliant companies re-evaluated their adoption of Linux,
       please clarify 're-evaluate`?
     * A. Unfortunately, a lot of the reaction to the lawsuits was
       discussed in private and with the expectation of confidentiality. I
       am not at liberty to provide details here from my experience (this
       is Tim writing.)

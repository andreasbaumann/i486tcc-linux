                          Compiling tcc with dietlibc

   by Martin Monperrus

   [1]Tcc (aka Tiny C Compiler, or tinycc) is a very lightweight C
   compiler. [2]Dietlibc is a lighweight libc (as opposed to [3]GNU libc).

   It is possible to compile tcc itself using dietlibc. First download the
   source code of tcc and install dietlibc (apt-get install dietlibc-dev).

   You have to do the following.

   In config.mak, modify the compiling and linking flags:
  CFLAGS=-I/usr/include/diet/ -D__dietlibc__ -DCONFIG_TCC_STATIC
  LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/diet/lib/ -nostartfiles

   CONFIG_TCC_STATIC says that dynamic loading (libdl) should not be used.
   However, there is a dependency to libdl at linking time (-ldl).

   In `Makefile':
     * remove LIBS+=-ldl.
     * add crt0.o to linked objects ` $(CC) -o $@ crt0.o $^ $(LIBS)
       $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $(LINK_LIBTCC)

   [4]crt0.o is the startup file which provides function _start as entry
   point. Function _start of dietlibc is in a file called start.o. We copy
   it to crt0.o (since this name is hard coded in tcc, see
   [5]http://www.monperrus.net/martin/compiling-c-code-with-dietlibc-and-t
   cc):
  $ cp /usr/lib/diet/lib/start.o crt0.o

   Then, simply build tcc:
  $ make

   Results: Using dietlibc, the resulting tcc weighs 211k and libtcc1.a
   16k. Using the GNU libc, it is respectively 583k and 52k.

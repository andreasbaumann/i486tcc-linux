Software minimalism

   From InstallGentoo Wiki
   Jump to: [3]navigation, [4]search

   Software Minimalism is a philosophy inherent to many [5]GNU/Linux
   distributions and other Unix like operating systems. The purpose of
   this page is to help newbies and advanced users alike by defining
   software minimalism and giving some ideas on where to start.

What does /g/ use?

   A common minimal configuration which can be seen among /g/ users in
   minimalism threads usually features some of the software below. For the
   most part everything is TUI

   NOTE: Examples here are based on the least bloated option available if
   no other alternatives exist.
     * Distro: [17]Gentoo, [18]OpenBSD, [19]Void Linux, [20]CRUX
       GNU/Linux, [21]9front, or [22]Alpine Linux);
     * Userland: busybox statically linked, [23]hbase, [24]suckless core
       (ubase, sbase, 9base) statically linked;
     * Window Manager: [25]DWM, rio, or TTY;
     * Login/Display manager: sx [26]edited version to use with sbase
       tty(1);
     * File Manager: Sometimes [27]noice, [28]nnn, or [29]LF, standard
       Unix utils like ls, cp, mv, etc.;
     * Terminal Emulator: [30]st;
     * Web Browser(note: web is bloat): [31]surf, [32]lynx, [33]netsurf,
       w3m, cURL;
     * gopher: [34]lynx, [35]sacc, or hURL;
     * Shell: [36]mksh or [37]dash;
     * OS information: they all rely on bash as a dependancy so just write
       you own or use ufetch if you run void;
     * Screen lock/saver: [38]slock;
     * Music player: [39]mpd + [40]mpc, or [41]cmus;
     * Video player: [42]mpv or ffplay (part of ffmpeg);
     * IRC client: [43]weechat, [44]irssi, [45]iii, [46]ii,erc;
     * Screen capture (screenshot): [47]scrot or [48]import (part of
       imagemagick);
     * Image viewer/desktop wallpaper display: [49]lel, [50]feh, or
       [51]sxiv and [52]hsetroot;
     * PDF Viewer: [53]zathura using the mupdf backend, or better yet to
       view PostScript or DjVu files, [54]mupdf;
     * Video conversion: [55]FFmpeg (including WebM or GIF creation);
     * Text editor: [56]acme (boarderline bloat), [57]Vim (boarderline
       bloat), [58]neovim (better), [59]Vis (best), or [60]sam, [61]Nano
       (if you don't need/want a modal editor), Emacs
     * Document creation: {g,t}roff, markdown;
     * Other: [62]doas (opendoas package on void) in place of sudo, 9front
       or plan9 and [63]factotum in place of Linux and PAM.

Unix Philosophy

   The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, is a set of cultural
   norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software
   development. The UNIX philosophy is documented by Doug McIlroy in the
   Bell System Technical Journal from 1978:
    1. Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh
       rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".
    2. Expect the output of every program to become the input to another,
       as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous
       information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats.
       Don't insist on interactive input.
    3. Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried
       early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the
       clumsy parts and rebuild them.
    4. Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming
       task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to
       throw some of them out after you've finished using them.

   This is often summarized as:
     * Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
     * Write programs to work together.
     * Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal
       interface.

Justification for Minimalism

   By Following the Unix Philosophy we can:
     * Make code that is easier to write and maintain
     * Facilitate easy scripting and automation
     * Decrease bugs in a code base
     * decrease vulnerabilities and remove attack vectors in our software
     * Become overall more efficient

   The power of unix is the power of the pipe and console redirection:
$ gunzip -dc file.tgz | tar xf -
$ cat /foo/bar.txt | grep "string"
$ bunzip2 < image.ff.bz2 | lel
$ bunzip2 < image.ff.bz2 | ff2png > sxiv
$ audio/mp3dec <foo.ogg >/dev/audio #(pulled from 9front audio(1) man page)
$ cat foo bar baz > foobarbaz
$ echo "append this text" >> foo
$ echo "overwrite with this text" > foo
$ cat foo.ps > /dev/lpt #to print on an lpt printer

   For a more indepth explaination read [64]Program Design in the UNIX
   Environment

Minimalism Rules of thumb

   A system cannot be minimal if it uses:
     * poetteringware or any freedesktop maintained software, this
       includes:
          + pulse audio
          + systemd
          + dbus
          + wayland
     * Gnome and GTK
     * KDE
     * GUI based tools
     * programs written to use XML
     * Any of the GNU tools
     * it is listed at [65]https://suckless.org/sucks/ or as harmful under
       [66]https://harmful.cat-v.org/software/

   And always remember, just because it runs in a terminal doesn't make it
   minimal!

Minimal Operating Systems

   Although strictly speaking every BSD and GNU/Linux distro isn't nearly
   as minimal as described in [67]Program Design in the UNIX Environment
   here are some Operating Systems that get close.
     * [68]9front - This is the closest thing to [69]Program Design in the
       UNIX Environment tier minimalism
     * [70]OpenBSD
     * [71]Void Linux - especially if using the musl version
     * [72]CRUX
     * [73]KISS Linux
     * [74]/g/entoo - can be made as minimal as you want it to be
     * [75]Alpine Linux - busybox/Linux

   Every modern Operating system has succumbed to extreme feature creep.
   Research UNIX was the first and last time that simple single use tools
   were in wide spread use. The GNU/Linux and BSD core utils include tons
   of added flags that go beyond what each tool is designed to do (such as
   the now popular example of cat -v) but beyond that some tools have
   defaults that are already multi-functional in nature such as ls having
   columnar output by default. 9front remedies this by having lc (list
   columns) but even then the days of a totally complete operating system
   that is designed according to the Unix Philosophy are long gone (if
   those days even existed is a matter of debate). As such, don't think
   too long and hard on which operating system to use. Almost any Linux or
   BSD system that doesn't use the GNU core utils and SystemD is already
   more minimal than 99% of what is being used by the vast majority of
   people.

   A lot of anons suggest Arch Linux or Debian netinst, but since both of
   these use a GNU userland and systemd they're not minimal.

Minimal metadistros

     * [76]LARBS
     * [77]InstantOS

File Systems

   A quick note on file systems. It is hard to find any way to judge how
   minimal a filesystem is, but here are some pointers using some common
   and/or popular examples.
     * EXT4: has encryption built in which is bloat since dm-crypt does a
       better job. Alternatives: F2FS, xfs (if you need extents)
     * ZFS: breaks file system layer seperation. Combines a LVM, database
       and filesystem into one program. Alternatives: HAMMER2, soft/hard
       raid with a seperate LVM and a
     * NTFS, EXFAT, HFS+, etc.: bloatware botnets. If you need
       compatability an alternative is UDF which has an open
       implementation is highly portable and an industry standard, any
       system capable of reading a DVD can read and write to a drive
       formatted to UDF.

   Some other considerations:

   If you're going to have separate partitions for different directories
   under root you might as well optimize while you're at it:
     * /usr is where most of your binaries and libraries are stored, so
       low latency is more important than throughput, suggest NILFS,
       REISERFS, or REISER4. 20GB
     * /etc rarely takes up much disk space. Most files stored here are
       small (in the order of no larger than a few hundred kilobytes).
       Usually CA's for ssl auth are located somewhere in /etc as well.
       Suggest, REISERFS, REISER4, NILFS. 1-2GB
     * /var contains small files, is where the database for your package
       manager usually is and spools are usually located. A filesystem
       with high throughput on smaller files would be preferred. Suggest
       REISERFS, REISER4. 15GB
     * /boot doesn't need anything fancy and journaling on disk can just
       get in the way, suggest Fat32. 512MB
     * / most nix systems have a hard time booting if the root directory
       is using a less popular filesystem, suggest EXT3 or xfs. 30GB is a
       safe bet
     * /home if you have an SSD you'll want a general use filesystem that
       is optimized for flash storage in which case F2FS is your best bet.
       If not, xfs or EXT3. Usually this takes up the rest of the file
       system.

   For the most bullet proof filesystem for something like a NAS you will
   probably want an atomic copy-on-write filesystem with checksumming,
   your best bet is HAMMER2.

   You could of course skip all of this heart ache and just use one /
   partition formatted to something like EXT3, F2FS, or xfs and call it a
   day.

Window Managers

   Currently most GNU/Linux and BSD distributions use the X Window System
   for drawing the desktop. It is designed to be modular and highly
   customizable. One of the results of this design is that X.org doesn't
   manage windows. Instead it depends on a special client application
   called a window manager. The window manager (WM in short) moves and
   resizes windows, among other things, often in response to user input.
   Window managers also do much more, like automatic window layout,
   compositing, drawing decorations, drawing panels, providing multiple
   workspaces, and so on.

   Window managers can be divided into these three categories:
     * Stacking - They allow windows to draw their contents one on top of
       another on the desktop, starting with the one on the bottom and
       going up in the "Z order".
     * Compositing - Provide a buffer for each window to draw on and then
       compose those buffers together creating the desktop image. This
       type of window manager allows use of semitransparent windows.
     * Tiling - The windows do not overlap.
          + Static tiling WMs such as ratpoison always use a set number of
            equal size tiles, and the tiles do not move
          + Dynamic tiling WMs such as awesome allow you to change the
            layout of the tiles, the number of tiles onscreen, and other
            things. it should be noted that awesome also has a stacking
            mode in addition to many tiling configurations.

   Many WMs contain both stacking and tiling modes, and the behavior can
   be switched by the user.

   Finally, there are also composite managers such as xcompmgr that work
   together with a non-compositing WM making it compose windows, allowing
   for effects such as transparency and drop shadows.

   Bloat
     * Dynamic
          + [78]Awesome - Despite looking pretty bad of the box, it's a
            very popular tiling window manager. It is completely
            scriptable in Lua, which makes it one of the most powerful and
            customizable window managers once you get around to
            programming the configuration file.
          + [79]i3 - One of the most popular window managers around, i3 is
            a fork of wmii that strives to fix the latter's convoluted
            code and documentation problems. Looks good out of the box and
            the configuration is simple and intuitive. It also provides a
            great amount of documentation on the webpage. Good for
            beginners and developers/hackers alike.

     * Stacking
          + [80]Openbox
          + [81]Fluxbox
          + [82]Blackbox

     * Compositing
          + [83]Compiz - A compositing WM being developed since 2006. It
            uses OpenGL (AIGLX). It is know for having a lot functionality
            and providing many interesting effects. However, it can cause
            problems if the graphics are faulty.
          + [84]KWin - A compositing WM used in KDE. It's comparable in
            feature set to compiz.
          + [85]Mutter - The default window manager for GNOME.
          + [86]Xfwm - The default window manager for XFCE.

   Minimal
     * Dynamic
          + [87]DWM - Doesn't come with a simple configuration file;
            instead, you're supposed to edit config.h and recompile dwm
            yourself. At least they make an effort to keep the code
            well-commented and under 2000 SLOC. Not for beginners as they
            themselves claim to want to "keep the userbase small and
            elitist", though you might want to give this a shot if you
            know C and you're willing to hack into the source code.
          + [88]monsterwm - Tiny but monstrous! Currently under 700 lines
            of code including the configuration file.

     * Tiling
          + [89]ratpoison - Minimal WM without the need of a mouse.
          + [90]bspwm
          + [91]xmonad - A minimal window manager written and configured
            in Haskell.
          + [92]WMFS2

     * Stacking
          + [93]Windowmaker - No-frills, very lightweight, fast. Makes
            your computer look like a mid-90s NeXTSTEP workstation.
          + [94]2bwm - Experimental "floating" WM that is only 342K
          + rio - default WM for plan9

     * Compositing tools (for stacking/tiling WMs)
          + [95]Compton - Forked of Xcompmgr size is only 255K

   There are also some anons who skip the GUI all together and do
   everything in framebuffer

Display Managers

   A display manager is what might typically be thought of as a "bloat".
   It will prompt you to enter a username to log in as, as well as specify
   a session to be used, in an inefficiant and bloated way. Use sx from a
   tty instead.

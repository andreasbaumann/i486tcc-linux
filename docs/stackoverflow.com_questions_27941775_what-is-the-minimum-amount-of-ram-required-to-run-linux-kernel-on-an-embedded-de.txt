[34]What is the minimum amount of RAM required to run Linux kernel on an

   What is the minimum amount of RAM required to run Linux kernel on an
   Embedded device? In Linux-0.11 for 80x86, the minimum RAM required was
   2MB to load the kernel data structures and interrupt vectors.

   How much is the minimum needed RAM for present Linux-3.18 kernel? Does
   different architectures like x86 and ARM have different requirements
   for minimum RAM required for booting? How does one calculates the same?

     * What are you trying to achieve? Depending on the device you're
       trying to squeeze Linux onto I'd imagine you might be able to shunt
       most of it off into (FLASH) ROM.

       Your question is too vague. Many Linux kernel features can be
       omitted if not needed, and consequently reduce the memory
       footprint. The types of daemons required and the applications will
       also dictate memory requirements. The processor architecture and
       instruction set impact memory requirements (e.g. for ARM the kernel
       can be compiled in Thumb mode, 16-bit, instructions to reduce
       kernel size).

     * Not only is it rather subjective; it is also temporal. The values
       will change over time; no one will care about 3.18 eventually.
       Also, a minimal configuration may not do what you want. <1MB is
       definitely possible with some Linux versions and configurations.
       For instance, you can remove procfs and/or sysfs, but most Linux
       user space programs may not work. Minimal might be no network, no
       sound, no mm, only initramfs and a console driver (maybe).

     * QEMU + buildroot 2017.02 x86_64 goes down to about 32MiB. Likely
       anything smaller will require patches / be insane.

   It's possible to shrink it down to ~600 KiB. Check the work done by Tom
   Zanussi from Intel. [52]Presentation from Tom and [53]Wiki page about
   the topic.

   UPDATE. Tom published interesting [54]statistics about memory use by
   different subsystems in the kernel. He did research during that time
   when he was working on the project.

   Yet another interesting project is [55]Gray486linux.

       I cannot see in either of those links anything to suggest 600KiB.
       Can you be more specific? Is that kernel image size of run-time RAM
       footprint? [60]This presentation shows stages to decreasing a
       distribution each increasingly smaller down to 1.6Mb, but at which
       point it is probably so crippled that it hardly becomes worth it -
       so it boots then what can you do with it!?
       - [61]Clifford
       Jan 14, 2015 at 21:36
     * 1.6M is a RAM size of the system, besides kernel you have to have
       RAM for other stuff, like init and / or shell. So, 600KiB is a RAM
       footprint of the kernel. But be aware that some stuff you have to
       compile in into user space programs like TCP/IP, IIRC.

   [67]This site suggests:

     A minimal uClinux configuration could be run from 4MB RAM, although
     the recommendation we are giving to our customers is that they
     should design in at least 16 MB's worth of RAM.

   If you are using SDRAM, the problem would be getting a part any smaller
   than 16Mb at reasonable volume cost and availability, so maybe it is a
   non-problem? For SRAM however, that is a large and relatively expensive
   part.

   eLinux.org has a [68]lot of information on embedded kernel size, how to
   determine it, and how to minimise it.

     * From the above provided link: The size of a bootable uClinux image,
       with integrated initramfs, worthy of the functionality capable of
       running from 16 MB of RAM would be in the 2-3 MB ballpark. What is
       the size of the uClinux kernel when it is uncompressed?

   It depends how you define Linux. If you ask for current operating
   systems then we are talking about way above 100MByte, better 1000MByte
   of memory.

   If we are talking about "Linux from Scratch" then we are also talking
   about how much pain you are willing to suffer. In the mid-1990 I build
   a Linux system by compiling every binary myself and made it run on a
   386sx16, 1,5MByte of memory. While it had a 40MByte harddrive it was
   mostly empty. I compiled my own Kernel 1.0.9, my own libc5, my own base
   tools, SVGAlib. That system was somewhat useable for using textmode and
   SVGAlib applications. Increasing the memory to 2MByte did help a lot.
   And believe me, the system was extremely bare. Today all components
   need at least twice the memory but then there is also ulibc instead of
   libc and busybox.

   At 8MByte of memory I can create a very basic system today from
   scratch. At 512MByte of memory you might have a somewhat modern looking
   but slow desktop system.

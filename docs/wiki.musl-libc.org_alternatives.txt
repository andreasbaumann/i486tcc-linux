     * [98]vbcc mostly C99 compatible C compiler. open source but non-free
       LICENSE.
     * [99]cproc very promising and clean C11 compiler, using QBE as its
       backend. can compile most C codebases, including GCC 4.7.4. roughly
       10x faster than GCC 8.
     * [100]lacc very fast C11 compiler, targetting amd64. not far away

Scripting languages

     * [105]Lua is a full-fledged small embeddable as well as standalone
       language. Pretty popular, but some semantic choices may make
       conscious programmer cringe: accessing non-existent (mistyped)
       variable returns legitimate value, array indexes start from 1, etc.
     * [106]Quasar m4 is a small GNU m4-compatible re-implementation
       derived from the FreeBSD m4.
     * [107]Squirrel is embeddable language with C-like syntax and minimal
       number of syntax/semantics idiosyncrasies. Uses reference counting.
       Core builds to ~250KB for i386. uses C++ though.
          + [108]General-Purpose Squirrel - fork to make a standalone
            general-purpose language out of Squirrel core, without
            compromising on lightweightedness.

     * [114]mupdf Lightweight PDF viewer.
     * [115]Poppler versus mupdf

Regular Expressions

   Musl's regular expressions pattern matching routines are based on the
   [116]TRE library. The Musl version of the code contains at least two
   bug fixes that were never fixed in the original code. For file pattern
   matching (fnmatch), musl uses an implementation based on the "Sea of
   Stars" algorithm.

   Comparing Perl regular expressions implementations to Regex
   implementations shows pattern matching performance for various cases,
   but it can be like comparing apples to oranges. Perl regular expression
   pattern matching is not equivalent to a regular language which can be
   solved by a finite state automata. Some regex extensions also may not
   be compliant with the definition of a formal regular language.
     * [117]Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast One
       comparison between regex and Perl regular expressions.
     * [118]Regex Benchmark Compares various regular expression methods'
       performances.
     * [119]PCRE performance Comparison of PCRE JIT with other regular
       expression methods' performances. Older performance comparisons
       don't typically include PCRE JIT which has better performance than
       standard PCRE. They just use standard PCRE.

       they prefer.
     * [138]Harmful software Uriel's alternatives list. Not maintained.

     * [144]MinGW Useful links I realize the page is for MinGW, but it has
       several cross-platform library recommendations including a large
       list of GUIs. It's easier to refer to that page than to try to
       maintain two sets of library lists (here and at the MinGW wiki) for
       certain categories.

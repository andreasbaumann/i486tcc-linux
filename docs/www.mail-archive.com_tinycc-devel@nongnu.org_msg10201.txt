Hello,

Hi
I'm trying to assemble the following snippet of code:

.global sigsetjmp
.global __sigsetjmp
.type sigsetjmp,@function
.type __sigsetjmp,@function
sigsetjmp:
__sigsetjmp:
        mov 8(%esp),%ecx
        jecxz 1f

        mov 4(%esp),%eax
        popl 24(%eax)
        mov %ebx,28+8(%eax)
        mov %eax,%ebx

.hidden ___setjmp
        call ___setjmp

        pushl 24(%ebx)
        mov %ebx,4(%esp)
        mov %eax,8(%esp)
        mov 28+8(%ebx),%ebx

.hidden __sigsetjmp_tail
        jmp __sigsetjmp_tail

1:      jmp ___setjmp
but getting this error:
src/signal/i386/sigsetjmp.s:8: error: invalid displacement
After renaming/moving the label around I assume the issue is that local
labels cannot be forward;1b and my_label moved to the top do work fine.



   Yeah, it's related to that, but specific to the 'jexcz' opcode: the
   special thing about it is that it only comes in an 8-bit displacement
   form _and_ doesn't have an inverse form. TCC, being single-pass, has to
   assume that forward labels could be anywhere, and hence potentially
   need a 32bit form (no matter that _in this case_ it would turn out to
   not be necessary), so jumps are rewritten into their disp32 forms for
   such labels. For jecxz that can't be done. And as the inverse form
   doesn't exist we can't even work around this by emitting something like
   a hypothetical:

  jecxnz +5   ; doesn't exist!
  jmp 1f


   The GNU assembler uses multiple passes to figure out that the
   displacement in the testcase turns out to fit into a disp8 field and
   hence all is well. Add a couple more opcodes between the jecxz and the
   1: label to make the distance larger than 128 and see it erroring out
   as well.


   Supporting this requires some surgery (e.g. to support the _PC8
   relocation and emitting them for this case only), so is of low
   priority.


Ciao,
Michael.
